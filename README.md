# Time Waits for No One: Scale Models and Logical Clocks

## 2nd Design Project for CS 262

## By Ashlan Ahmed, Charles Ma, and Christy Jestin

The scale model can be run via the following commands:

-   `python3 process.py ip_addr a`
-   `python3 process.py ip_addr b`
-   `python3 process.py ip_addr c`

`ip_addr` is the IP address of your machine. Note that our implementation requires that the three processes must be run in this order.
